                    <h2> Usability Test Results </h2>
                    <p>
                        One significant observation I learned was that the color of the interface seemed feminine to most people.
                    They believed that the topic of sexual assault is not only a feminine thing so the color of it should be changed so that it is more inclusive.
                Another observation I made during this usability testing project is that for the share your story page, the form fields to
                share your story should be on the same page rather than on two separate pages. Lastly, an observation I made through usability testing is that
                people have a hard time locating the hamburger icon at the top left for our menu. It is very small so I need to update this and make it bigger.</p>
              
                <p> For the final project, I will make sure to look into other color palletes that can be more inclusive to all genders. Also,
                    I would really like to make Back4App work since it wasn't working too well for this usability test. </p>
