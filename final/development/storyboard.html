            I had initially done my storyboard wrong in which I sketched someone facing this equity issue and forgot to include how they
            ended up resolving it through my final project interface. In the second storyboard, I was able to incorporate this. I really
            enjoyed testing this storyboard with a classmate becuase I got to hear some good feedback and they even gave me some more
            ideas on what I can do for my final project
