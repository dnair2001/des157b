            <h2>Source 1 - The "Opportunity" Gap in US Public Education -- and how to close it</h2>
            <p>Our school system perpetuated the social divide. It makes worse what they are supposed to fix. He believes kids
                have the ability to do well and wants to see them succeed. White school districts get 23 billion more in funding
                than non-white schools. A lot of schools don't have the proper funding and many school teachers are under paid.
                He said that a child's education should not be determined by birth. A public education system should not create
                a wider bottom and narrow top. The teacher strikes were successful because of community support. It increased 
                teacher pay, gave smaller class sizes, and gave the school more counselors. He talks about how some students have
                a silver spoon that help them gain important skills. We need to save our schools first in order to save our
                students. The author is a sociologist who gives a TED talk on the opportunity gap in the US public education.</p>
            <h2>Source 2 - Opportunity Gap</h2>
            <p>This video gives a clear definition of "opportunity gap" through the use of real life examples. The opportunity gap is
                based on the availability of resources. The speaker then compares this to an achievement gap which is uneven distribution of
                educational results or benefits. We can close the achievement gap by confronting the opportunity gap. Achievement is
                directly related to opportunity. Also, a positive and encouraging school environment staffed with people who believe
                in their students can change lives. This video is from the Washington State Board of Education which is big organization 
                showing its credibility because they are directly related to a school organization.        
            </p>
            <h2>Source 3 - Solving the Achievement Gap through Equity, Not Equality</h2>
            <p>The achievement gap occurs when one student scores higher than another when they are grouped by gender, race, ethnicity, 
                or socio-economic status. Equity would close this achievement gap by giving the needed support and support structures to those
                very different groups. Equality and Equity are actually two very different things. To close the achievement gap, we need to 
                design a curriculum for every student and their learning style. The only type of ability that is really valued in our society
                is that high analytical ability that is generally correlated with math and languages. However, only a small fraction of
                students fit this category. The speaeker talks about bringing equity in the classroom. The speaker Dr. Lindsey F. Ott is a
                teacher so she understands this discussion on a personal level since she is affected by it.
