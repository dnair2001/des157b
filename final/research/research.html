            <h2>Source 1 - The "Opportunity" Gap in US Public Education -- and how to close it</h2>
            <p>Our school system perpetuated the social divide. It makes worse what they are supposed ot fix. He believes kids
            have the ability to do well and wants to see them succeed. White school districts get 23 billion more in funcing
            than non-white schools. A lot of schools don't have the proper funding and many school teachers are under paid.
            He said that a child's education should not be determined by birth. A public education system should not create
            a wider bottom and narrow top. The teacher strikes were successful because of community support. It increased 
            teacher pay, gave smaller class sizes, and gave the school more counselors. He talks aout how some students have
            a silver spoon that help them gain important skils. We need to save our schools first in order to save our
            students. The author is a sociologist who gives a TED talk on the opportunity gap in the US public education.</p>
            <h2>Source 2 - Opportunity Gap</h2>
            <p>This video gives a cear definition of "opportunity gap" through the use of real life examples. The opporutnity gap is
                based on the availiabiltiy of resources. The speaker then comapres this to an achievement gap which is uneven distrubition of
                educational results or benefits. We can close the achievement gap by confronting the opportunity gap. Achievement is
                directly related to opportunity. Also, a positive and encouraging school environment staffed with people who believe
                in their students can change lives.           
            </p>
            <h2>Source 3 - Solving the Achievement Gap through Equity, Not Equality</h2>
            <p>The achievemnt gap occurs when one student scores higher than another when they are group by gender, race, ethnicity, 
                or socioeconomic status. Equity would close this achievemnt gap by giving the needed support and support structures to those
                very different groups. Equality and Equity are actually two very different things. To close the achievement gap, we need to 
                design a curriculum for every student and their learning style. The only type of ability that is reallt valued in our society
                is that high analytical ability that is generally correlated with math and languages. hHowever, only a small fraction of
                students fit this category. The speaeker talks about bringing equity in the classroom.
